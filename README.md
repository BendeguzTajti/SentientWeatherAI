# SentientWeatherAI

Sentient Weather AI (SWAI) is a simple weather app, that shows you detailed weather information.

## Technologies
- `Jetpack compose`
- `Kotlin` and `Kotlin flows`
- `Clean Architecture`
- `Retrofit`
- `Hilt`
- `Animated vector drawables` with `Shape Shifter`

I also created a mock design in `Figma`, which you can find here:

## Usage

After you accepted the location permission the app will show you the latest weather data at your current location.
You can also search for a town/city by speech or text and the app will display the latest weather data at the given location.
The app will also change its colors depending on the location's sunset/sunrise data.
